The presentation is divided into 3 sections for each sub-topic and each sub-topic is divided into 3 slides. it'll start with an **introduction** (slide 1) and end with a **conclusion** (slide 11). Then the following core structure will be:

##### Section 1 - SSAE 16 Type II - 3 Slides:
- **Slide 1:** First slide will discuss the _"What"_  behind the SSAE 16 and the difference between Its Types.
- **Slide 2:** Second slide will discuss the difference between SSAE 16 & 18
- **Slide 3:** Third slide will discuss about _"How"_  & _"Why"_  SSAE 16/18 compliments or fulfil our objective which is government agency.
	- For Example: Explain _"Why"_  SSAE 18 is better for a government agency.
## Introduction - Slide 1
Introduction will describe the _"What"_  & _"Why"_  behind our objective.
- For Example: What is our objective for this presentation?
	- And Why this objective is a matter/worthy of discussion?
This slide will contain **overview**, or simply ToC of our whole presentation.
#### Content:
- The Objective of this presentation is to secure Government Sensitive data in Cloud systems through ISO 27001's ISMS by utilizing Cloud-Native Security Tools and assuring the implementation of controls, specifically the controls regarding the protection of financial information by SSAE 16 Type II audit.
- As we know, government is a very sensitive sector for each nation-state, so its protection is above every other aspect of economy. Well, in the era of technology specially the Cloud Technology, government does not waste their efforts building an on-premise location, rather they use cloud platforms for their daily work. Now, the security regarding cloud is really sensitive, and there could be many threats to the government systems. To protect these systems there are some policies, procedures, and tools which must be followed and utilized by both Government agency as well as Cloud Provider to protect the data in cloud.

| That's my writing behind what I will discuss in introduction, I think the reasoning here is lacking some professional tone, if so then refine it. Also above writing is not my presentation content, you can produce the bullet point required for this intro, and I like any suggestions from you to make it better. Just guide me, do not tell the exact content I'll write it myself, just guide me |

### Section 1 - SSAE 16 Type II
#### Slide 2: What is SSAE 16?
- SSAE 16 is an auditing standard for assertion, proposed by AICPA.
- It was a successor of SAS 70 standard which lacks reporting.
- internal Controls Over Financial Reporting is the ideology of SSAE 16.
- SSAE 16 ensure that the controls regarding financial information are being implemented or not.
- SSAE 16 is limited to SOC 1 report.
#### Slide 3: The Successor of SSAE 16
- SSAE 16 has a very concise scope while SSAE 18 is broader in scope.
- SSAE 18 has a great emphasis on Risk Analysis while SSAE 16 does not include risk in its attestation.
- SSAE 16 does not propose the idea of monitoring sub-service organization while SSAE 18 does.
- SSAE 18 compliment other international compliance standards.
- SSAE 18 can fulfil the Trust Service Criteria while SSAE 16 cannot.
| I can't think of good transitioning last point for this slide. You can change the last point I've added |
#### Slide 4: How does SSAE 16 Type II compliment Government agency?
- SSAE 16 Type II can be highly beneficial in the context of financial reporting.
- SSAE 16 Type II report can reduce the burden of attestation from the government agency's auditors.
- SSAE 16 Type II measure the operational effectiveness of controls as well as for how long those controls were being implemented with due care.
- SSAE 16 Type II enhance's the trust and credibility of government agency in its cloud provider.
- But it still does not fulfil the Trust Services Criteria, which is the utmost requirement of government agency to trust its cloud provider.
|Here, I need a strong last point for transition because I'm now moving to ISO 27001 (2nd sub-topic). You can tweak with my point but if you got better option, then go for it. also reason why you think you have a good point|

### Section 2 - ISO 27001
#### Slide 5: What is ISO 27001?
- ISO 27001 is an international compliance standard, which sets the baseline for securing systems in any organization
- ISO 27001 require's establishment, implementation, maintenance and continual improvement of its policies and procedures through an Information Security Management System.
- ISO 27001 propose's a Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle for continuous security approach.
- ISO 27001 is also supported by ISO 27002 which consist of the controls required by ISO 27001 to be implemented.
- It is highly focused on Risk Assessment and Risk Treatment.
#### Slide 6: Risk Driven Approach
- ISO 27001 propose a whole risk management approach for better risk treatment.
- Risk Assessment is the process of identification, Analysis and Evaluation of specific risk.
- Risk Treatment is the process of deciding what to do with the identified risk.
- This approach can also help Top Management in decision making for business goals.
- In the end, SoA is produced to justify the implemented controls in order to confirm the inclusion or exclusion of controls regarding the risk management.
#### Slide 7: How does ISO 27001 compliment government agency?
- ISO 27001 certification in cloud proves that their ISMS is efficiently operational and auditable.
- A government entity can be assured of the security posture of their cloud provider.
- ISO 27001 adds another layer of trust and credibility for government entity in their cloud provider.
- The SoA from cloud provider is an essential document to review by government agency.
|I can't think of the last point, please do something. Also I think I've messed up in this section somewhere, if so then correct it.|

### Section 3 - Cloud-Native & Open-Source Tools
#### Slide 8: Cloud-Native Security Tools
- Cloud Native security tools can be utilized to maintain security inside cloud environment, reducing the hastle of integrating third party security tool.
- The requirements of Shared Responsibility Model can be fulfilled by Government agency using Cloud-native tools to establish security in the cloud.
- GCP Security Command Center can be utilized for Cloud Security Posture Management as well as completing the CIS benchmark provided by GCP to improve security posture.
- Azure Security Center can also be utilized for CSPM but it also provides security for systems, containers etc. through its component called Cloud Workload Protection.
- There's no centralization and connection between two different cloud providers.
| I don't know what I've written down, I mean just what I know I've wrote down, and I don't think it looks good enough especially the last point so work on it properly |
#### Slide 9: SIEM and Logging
- Security Information and Event Management is a tool used for threat detection and prevention.
- Wazuh is powerful SIEM tool, known for its HIDS and FIM.
- Wazuh can be utilized for centralized logging to refine incident response strategies.
- Wazuh can be used for correlating logs from multi-cloud environment as well as on-premise systems.
- A SIEM like Wazuh can provide a bird eye view of the organization's security posture and can be highly customizable.
#### Slide 10: How Tools compliment a government entity in cloud environment?
- 
- 
| I honestly don't have any words of description for this section, maybe I'm still confused. But I have time, I'll prepare more. And I've totally messed up in this section because of less clarity. I'm leaving the last slide for you so go for it. I've understood that I'm totally weak in this sub-topic, I have to clarify everything regarding tools and SIEM. |

### Conclusion
A robust compliance standard like ISO 27001 is a baseline requirement in information security. An information security management system should be in practice, and continual improvement of ISMS is must to protect organization's assets from modern threats. The importance of SSAE 16 or 18 assurance is indeed a contractual requirement by government agency specially the SSAE 18 SOC 2 Type II report. The cloud-native like GCP Security Command Center and Microsoft Defender for Cloud as well as open-source tools like Wazuh can be utilized in implementing the controls required by ISO 27001.

|I honestly don't know how to or where to conclude, summarization is my weakness. Help me with this. I just tried to summarize here but I think I didn't fulfil the conclusion in a way it has to be done. like with a bang!|
