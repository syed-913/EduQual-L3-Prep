# Objective
Use **ISO/IEC 27001 to protect sensitive government data** against _security threats_.
___
#### What is ISO/IEC 27001 and Its Supporting Document?
- An ISO 27001 is an international regulatory standard for **managing** information security. It provides a baseline of controls and highly focused on *risk assessment* and *risk treatment* procedure (because **management** of Information security revolved around **risk**). ISO 27001 represents _what_ should be implemented, like an ISMS.
- **ISO 27002:**
	- ISO 27001 is itself does not display or explain the detail of controls but a supporting document named ISO 27002 contains that (A list of all the Controls). ISO 27002 talks about _how_ controls should be implemented, in that ISMS.
- In simple terms, ISO 27001 specifies the requirements for *establishing*, *maintaining*, *implementing*, and *continually improving* an Information Security Management System (ISMS). While ISO 27002 defines those *controls* which should be implemented by ISMS.
#### What is an ISMS?
- **Information Security Management System:**
	- ISMS is a *practical representation* of the written policies, processes, procedures and systems. The **Information Security Management System (ISMS)** is the **actual system** of policies, processes, procedures, and resources that an organization establishes, implements, maintains, and continually improves to manage its information security risks, _as required by ISO 27001_. In simple terms, every work in practical, done by the people, process and technology to fulfil the rules of ISO 27001 (specifically) is considered Information Security Management System. This system manage's risks associated with information security.
#### What is The Difference between ISO 27001 & ISMS?
- **ISO 27001:** ISO 27001 is a book of rules (or simply a _guide_) which direct's an organization about _what_ should be done in need for securing their Information and manage risks associated with it. It is the written form of a practical work.
- **Information Security Management System:** ISMS is managing information security in practical terms. It is the practical work done by the people, process and technology under the rules and controls defined in ISO 27001.
- **For Example:** If an organization is audited to be "ISO 27001 certified" then its inner workings like the controls being implemented, risk management, etc. are in practice.
>[!note] ISO 270001 Bad Practice
>It is totally a bad decision to implement all controls listed in an ISO document. Because it can **limit** the organization system and the business will be **impacted negatively**. Remember every aspect of an organization should enables business, and security will enable business, only if it is handled correctly.
#### What are the most Important clauses in ISO 27001 which builds the foundation of ISMS? and Why?
##### Clause 4: Context of Organization
- **4.1 – Understanding the Organisation and its Context:**
	- It requires an organization to identify and assess their internal and external issues/context, which can impact its ability to achieve their information security objective. Simply, it requires an organization to measure their scope.
- **4.2 – Understanding the Needs and Expectations of Interested Parties:**
	- The organization must understand the needs and expectation of its stakeholders. It is because if something is required by stakeholders, and is not provided to them, then it can cause issues in achieving the organization's Information Security or ISMS objective.
- **4.3 – Determining the Scope of the Information Security Management System:**
	- Scope is the baseline for ISMS, it helps in identifying and documenting the information assets (both tangible and intangible), processes, people, procedures, systems and networks. Scope is the most important aspect of ISO 27001 or ISMS.
##### 5. Leadership
- **5.1 – Leadership & Commitment:**
	- The continuous involvement of top management is must. The management must monitor and hold responsibility and accountability for any inconvenience, also audit and address any kind of weakness and non-conformities in people, process and technology.
- **5.2 – Information Security Policy:**
	- A set of procedures to manage information security properly. These policies delivered by ISO 27001 must be approved by top management. It covers various factors such as business strategy, regulations, legislation, and current and projected information security risks and threats.
- **5.3 – Organisational Roles, Responsibilities & Authorities:**
	- Each and every individual is assigned to its respective role and should be responsible as well as accountable for it, and individuals are divided into groups to address and deal different aspects of information security. Organization must ensure that each individual is moderately trained and posses necessary skills to fulfil their role and responsibilities.

Leadership include an active attention from top management for monitoring purposes and the top management must approve the information security policy proposed by ISO 27001. And they (top management) must assign roles and responsibilities respectively and the responsible stakeholders must be responsible and accountable for their due care/due diligence.
##### 6. Planning
- **6.1 – Actions to Address Risks and Opportunities:**
	- It requires a full fledged risk management plan from organization, which includes identify, evaluate, treat and monitor cycle. Risk management helps remediating potential risks and protect personal data and ensure integrity and availability of information systems.
- **6.2 – Information Security Objectives & Planning to Achieve them:**
	- An organization must develop a plan to achieve their objective. These objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound (SMART), and these objective should align with overall business objectives. The plan should outline the procedures, resources and timeline to achieve the organization's objective.

The Planning phase is an overview of procedures, resources and timeline  requires a complete plan regarding the risk management cycle from organization. The planning is highly focused on risk remediation and objective achievement. Planning also include's a specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound (SMART) objective.
##### 7. Support
- **7.1 – Resources:**
	- Each and everything that supports an ISMS, directly or indirectly. It can be anything like people, process and technology. The organisation must ensure that these resources are available and accessible when needed.
- **7.2 – Competence:**
	- By ensuring that personnel are competent, organisations can effectively manage their information security performance and protect personal data.
- **7.3 – Awareness:**
	- This includes providing training and education on information security topics, ensuring personnel understand the organisation’s security policies and procedures, and the consequences of not following them.
- **7.4 – Communication:**
	- Requirement 7.4 focuses on the need for organisations to establish effective communication practices to ensure information security objectives are met. This includes communication with relevant stakeholders, the Commissioner in the event of a personal data breach, and between all involved parties.
- **7.5 – Documented Information:**
	- ISO 27001 asks you to describe your information security management system and then to demonstrate how its intended outcomes are achieved for the organisation. It is incredibly important that everything related to the ISMS is documented and well maintained, easy to find, if the organisation wants to achieve an independent ISO 27001 certification form a body like UKAS.

Support clause highlights the importance for the availability of the operational assets, active attention from stakeholders and communication between them. It also require's to educate stakeholders about security best practices to avoid human error (The weakest link in security), as well as it require's documented information from the organization about their ISMS and understand its operational effectiveness.
##### 8. Operation
- **8.1 – Operational Planning & Control:**
	- This involves identifying and assessing risks associated with the organisation’s operations and implementing appropriate security controls to mitigate those risks. The organisation must also develop and implement policies and procedures to protect its information from unauthorised access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction.
- **8.2 – Information Security Risk Assessment:**
	- The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that organisations are aware of potential risks to their information security management system and can take necessary steps to mitigate them. The process involves identifying, assessing, and managing risks to the organisation’s information assets. This includes analysing the organisation’s information assets, identifying threats and vulnerabilities associated with those assets, and evaluating the potential impact of a security breach.
- **8.3 – Information Security Risk Treatment:**
	- This involves identifying and assessing risks associated with the processing of personal data and implementing appropriate security measures to mitigate those risks. These measures can include access control, encryption, and data backup. Organisations should ensure that any externally provided processes, products, or services relevant to the information security management system are controlled. Documented information of the results of the information security risk treatment should also be retained.

The operation phase require a plan of controls backed by policies o be executed for the purpose of protecting sensitive information. Operation itself is a process of risk assessment and treatment, where the identification (of asset and the relating vulnerability), assessing (analyzing the likelihood of that risk and its impact), evaluating (understanding that the risk require's treatment or not) and then the treatment (like remediating, mitigating or accepting the risk).
##### 9. Performance Evaluation
- **9.1 – Monitoring, Measurement, Analysis and Evaluation:**
	- If the organisation is seeking certification for ISO 27001 the independent auditor working in a certification body associated to UKAS (or a similar accredited body internationally for ISO certification) will be looking closely at the following areas:
		- What it has decided to monitor and measure, not just the objectives but the processes and controls as well.
		- How it will ensure valid results in the measuring, monitoring, analysis and evaluation.
		- When that measurement, monitoring, evaluation and analysis takes place and who does it.
		- How the results get used.
- **9.2 – Internal Audit:**
	- ISO 27001 says that an organisation shall conduct internal audits at planned intervals to provide information on whether the information security management system:
		- Conforms to the organisation’s own requirements for its information security management system; and meets the requirements of the ISO 27001 international standard.
		- Whether the ISMS is effectively implemented and maintained.
- **9.3 – Management Review:**
	- ISO 27001 Requirement 9.3 requires organisations to conduct regular management reviews to ensure the ongoing suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness of their information security management system.

		These reviews should be conducted at planned intervals, at least annually, and should involve senior management or a designated representative.

		The purpose of the management review is to assess the organisation’s information security policies, procedures, and controls, as well as its risk assessment and risk management processes.

		It also involves evaluating the organisation’s compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
##### 10. Improvement
- **10.1 – Nonconformity and Corrective Action:**
	- Nonconformities can include failures to meet the requirements of the standard, deficiencies in the information security management system, or any other issues that could lead to a security breach.

		When a nonconformity is identified, the organisation must take corrective action to address it. The corrective action should be appropriate to the severity of the nonconformity and designed to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.

		The effectiveness of the corrective action must be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that the nonconformity does not recur.
- **10.2 – Continual Improvement:**
	- This means that organisations need to regularly review and update their ISMS to ensure its effectiveness and alignment with the organisation’s objectives, legal and regulatory requirements, and the ISO 27001 standard.

		The continual improvement process should be monitored and reviewed to ensure its effectiveness, and any necessary changes should be made to enhance the suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness of the ISMS.

#### What are the Controls mentioned in Annex A of ISO 27001?
- The Annex A section (as mentioned earlier) is derived from ISO 27002, which is a set of comprehensive security controls.

	The ISO 27001 provides _what_ should be done by defining requirements to fulfil and ISO 27002 tells _how_ it should be done by defining controls to fulfil those requirements. Following are the overview of controls mentioned in ISO 27002:
##### Organizational Controls
- Organisational controls are measures that help organisations protect their information assets by establishing a culture of security and defining clear roles and responsibilities. They are not targeted at specific personnel, or physical or technological threats, but rather at the organisation as a whole.
	
	Organisational controls include:
	- **Information security policy:** This policy defines the principles and objectives of information security management.  
      
    
	- **Responsibilities and authorities:** Clear roles and responsibilities for information security are defined.  
      
    
	- **Management ownership:** Management understands and fulfils its role in implementing an information security strategy.  
      
    
	- **Information classification:** Information assets are classified according to their information security needs, and appropriate measures are developed.

##### People-Related Controls
- The people-related controls of the ISO 27001 framework ensure that employees and other persons who have access to information systems and data have an appropriate understanding of information security and comply with it.

	This means that it defines responsibilities, appropriate training and access to knowledge as well as obligations of the organization and employees with regard to the handling of sensitive information. This also includes topics such as remote working, non-disclosure agreements, on-boarding and off-boarding processes and responsibilities for reporting incidents.

	Among other things, they include:

	- **Training and awareness** campaigns to sensitise employees to information security risks  
      
	- **Policies and procedures** governing the secure handling of information  
      
	- **Processes for the selection**, recruitment and monitoring of employees  
      
	- **Measures to promote a culture of information security** within the organization

##### Physical Controls
- Physical controls include security monitoring, maintenance, facility security, and storage media. This set of controls contains measures that protect the physical security of information and information systems. They include measures to secure buildings, rooms, and facilities, to control access to these areas, and to prevent damage to information systems.
	
	Physical controls include, among others:
	
	- Protecting all physical premises and controlling access to prevent unauthorised access and damage.  
      
	- Protecting premises and information from physical and environmental damage.  
      
	- Providing secure workplaces to protect information in secure areas from damage.  
      
	- Establishing guidelines for handling equipment and storage media to avoid damage, loss, or theft

##### Technological Controls
- Technological controls include the authentication and encryption of data and the prevention of data loss. To protect the data, the technology must also be secured accordingly. Access rights, network security and data masking help to achieve this security.

	In other words, these controls are designed to ensure that technical vulnerabilities are prevented and that software and systems are protected against malware. Access to software and services is regulated and documented for this purpose, and all information that is no longer used is deleted.
	Technological controls include, among other things:

	- The deletion of all information that is no longer necessary  
      
	- The management of technical vulnerabilities and the corresponding protection  
      
	- Protective measures against malware  
      
	- Measures for masking data

#### What is Risk Assessment and Risk Treatment? And How its Done?
- Risk assessment is the process of identifying, analyzing and evaluating the risk. However the treatment of risk involves the measure or procedures considered to manage the risk effectively.
- The reason for this in context of ISMS is that it helps in addressing the risk and reducing the impact produced by that risk.
##### Risk Assessment Process:
- **Asset Identification:** Identifying an asset requires identifying that which asset possess that specific risk.
	- For Example: MySQL database is an intangible asset which require's risk assessment because its the storage area for sensitive information.
- **Identifying Threat:** Identifying what could cause harm to this asset.
	- For Example: Information Disclosure, Data Exfiltration, Data Breach etc.
- **Identifying Vulnerability:** Understanding by which mean or vulnerability that risk can be exploited by the threat actor.
	- For Example: SQL injection etc.
- **Analyzing Risk:** What is the likelihood to exploit that vulnerability? And what is the impact on business?
	- For Example: Likelihood related to SQL injection is severely high because its less complicated vulnerability exploited by anyone with common IT knowledge, and its impact is critically high because it can expose sensitive data.
- **Evaluating Risk:** Determine if the risk is acceptable based on the organization's risk acceptance criteria.
	- For Example: A risk related to MySQL database seems high likelihood and have critical impact which eliminates the thought of acceptance from the risk assessors mind. These is no tolerance for this kind of risk, so it should be treated.
##### Risk Treatment
- **Mitigate:** Mitigation involves applying controls to limit the likelihood and impact of that risk to an acceptable level.
- **Avoid:** A risk can be avoided by eliminating the asset completely.
- **Transfer:** It can be done by shifting the risk to another party.
	- For Example: Storing data on the MySQL server of GCP, now GCP is responsible to deal with that risk associated with SQL database.
- **Accept:** A risk can be accepted only in two conditions:
	- If its likelihood and impact is very low.
	- If the financial investment for the treatment of that risk outweighs its potential impact.

As the technology evolve and new threats emerge, the process of Assessment and Treatment becomes continuous. Risk Assessment and Treatment is a repeatable process involving continuous attention from organization's stakeholders.
>[!danger] Risk Theory
>Its totally superficial to think the risk could be **eliminated totally**. Its impossible to posses an asset which produce's risk and only eliminating its risk completely.

#### What is an SoA?
- **Statement Of Applicability:** A Statement of Applicability is a mandatory document required by ISO 27001. This document serves as a proof about the reason behind each security control. Following is the explanation:
	- **Document Control Selection:** As I said earlier not all controls are considered for implementation from Annex A, but only those which are relevant to the organization.
	
		These selection of controls are precisely documented in this Statement Of Applicability, this document explicitly mention the security controls being implemented by the organization currently.
	- **Justifying Inclusion & Exclusion:** This is where the ISO 27001 requires a responsible justification/reason from organization about inclusion and exclusion of security controls. The organization needs to justify the following:
		- _Why_ a control from Annex A is excluded?
			- **Reason:** The asset is not present in organization.
		- _Why_ a control from Annex A is included or implemented?
			- **Reason:** Its necessary to treat an identified risk.
	- **Linking to Risk Treatment:** This demonstrates that the controls which are being implemented are directly linked to the Risk Assessment and Risk Treatment to reduce the risk to an acceptable level.
	- **Demonstrating Compliance:** For an external auditor, the SoA is a key document. It shows that the organization has systematically identified its risks, chosen appropriate controls, and justified its decisions, thus meeting a fundamental requirement of ISO 27001.

# Questions
- What and Why is the concept people, process and technology? And where it fits in our objective or topic?
	- **What it is:** The **"People, Process, and Technology" (PPT)** triad is a widely recognized framework for understanding the interdependent components that make up any effective system or operation, especially in information security.
	- **Why it's important:** Security isn't _just_ about buying the latest firewall (technology), or writing a security policy (process), or training employees (people). A weakness in any one area can compromise the entire security posture. They must work in **harmony**.
- What lays the foundation for ISO 27001? I mean its fundamental, famous, useful and common in GRC, what aspect of ISO 270001 supports it so much and make it most fundamental and unique beside every other compliance standard?
	- The fundamental aspect that makes ISO 27001 so robust, unique, and highly regarded in GRC, especially compared to other compliance standards, is its **management system approach centered around Risk Management and Continual Improvement.**
		
		Many compliance standards (like PCI DSS for credit card data) are prescriptive checklists: "You MUST do A, B, and C." While valuable, they can become outdated or apply poorly to unique organizational contexts.
		- **Is Risk-Driven:** It forces you to identify your specific information security risks and then select controls _appropriate to those risks_.
		- **Is Management-Led:** It ensures that information security is not just an IT department's problem but is integrated into the organization's strategic objectives with top management buy-in and accountability.
		- **Is Process-Oriented:** It emphasizes repeatable processes (planning, operation, communication, etc.) rather than one-off activities.
		- **Is Continually Improving:** The ISMS is regularly monitored, audited, reviewed, and updated. This ensures the organization adapts to new threats, vulnerabilities, and business changes, maintaining its effectiveness over time.
- What is this Shared Responsibility Model in Organizational Controls?
	- The Shared Responsibility Model defines the division of security responsibilities between a **cloud provider** (like Azure or GCP) and the **cloud customer** (like a government agency).
		- **Cloud Provider :** Is responsible for **"security _of_ the cloud."** This means the physical security of data centers, the underlying infrastructure, the host operating systems, the network, and the virtualization layer. They ensure the cloud *itself* is secure.
		- **Cloud Customer :** Is responsible for **"security _in_ the cloud."** This includes the security of their data, applications, operating systems (if using IaaS), network configuration within their virtual private cloud (VPC), identity and access management (IAM), and encryption.
- When SoA is required? like after every audit? or after every risk assessment and treatment process? and for how many time intervals it is repeated?
	- Statement of Applicability is required during the ISMS establishment or before the ISO 27001 **certification audit**. The SoA is not tied to change in a specified time i.e. monthly, whenever there's significant change in organization, especially with risk assessment and treatment.
