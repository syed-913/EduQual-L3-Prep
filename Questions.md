## Questions I like to ask to Sir Faisal:
Q1: I like to pursue my career either in penetration testing of network or web app or Digital Forensics because both of the domains acquire steep learning curve, practical attention and continuous challenge. I like to have your advice or any sort of assistance from you, so do you have any suggestions?

Q2: I have not received my completion certificate of DCCS, Can you please let me know when it will be available to me?

Q3: I'd like to get degree from a foreign university, so can you please guide on how Pearson can assist me in achieving that? Also do you guarantee an admission in a foreign university after completion of Pearson HND? If so than what will be the expense I would have to be prepared for?
