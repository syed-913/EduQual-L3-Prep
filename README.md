# EduQual Level 3 Oral Presentation Resources

Hey there! 👋
If you’re reading this, you probably came here from my [Medium story](error404). If not, feel free to check it out  —  it walks through my entire journey of preparing for and passing the **EduQual RQF Level 3 Oral Presentation** with Al-Nafi.
